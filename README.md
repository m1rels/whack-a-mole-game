# Whack-A-Mole-Game
Whack-A-Mole-Game is a grid-based game I have coded by myself.
The game is real fun so just try it out:)

## Try it out

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1rels/Whack-A-Mole-Game
   ```

2. In VS Code go to index.html, right-click and choose "Open with Live Server". You should see the game popping up in your browser.
